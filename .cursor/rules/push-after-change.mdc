# Push to GitHub After Changes

After making any code or config changes to this project:

1. Stage changes: `git add -A` (or stage only the files you changed).
2. Commit with a clear message: `git commit -m "Brief description of change"`.
3. Push to GitHub: `git push origin main`.

Do this at the end of your response whenever you have modified files, unless the user explicitly asks not to push.
