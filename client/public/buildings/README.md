## Image Guidelines

### Format
- Use **JPEG** for photographs and renders (better compression)
- Use **PNG** for floor plans and diagrams (better for line art)

### Size
- Hero images: 1920x1080px (Full HD)
- Floor plans: 800x600px or higher
- Keep file sizes under 500KB for optimal performance

### Optimization
- Use tools like TinyPNG or ImageOptim to compress images
- Maintain 80-85% quality for JPEGs
- Use progressive JPEG format

### Fallbacks
The application includes fallback placeholder images. However, for the best user experience, provide all required images.

## Current Status

⚠️ **Missing**: All images need to be added by the client.

When images are ready, simply drop them in this directory with the correct filenames.
